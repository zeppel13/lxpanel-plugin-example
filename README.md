# lxpanel-plugin-example
This is a minimum example for writing lxpanel plugins based on the lxde wiki

read this: https://wiki.lxde.org/en/How_to_write_plugins_for_LXPanel

I couldn't find a good barebones minimal plugin for lxpanel (the panel of lxde). 
The code comes from the instruction page of lxde. This repo could be used as a minimal skeleton for writing future plugins.
